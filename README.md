# Lattice QCD with Dynamical Quarks
### Project Overview

This project focuses on the implementation and study of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with dynamical quarks. The aim is to explore the numerical methods used to simulate QCD on a lattice, which is a crucial approach for understanding the non-perturbative aspects of the strong interaction in quantum field theory.
### Features

    - Lattice QCD Framework: The project employs a lattice discretization of QCD, which allows for the study of quark and gluon interactions in a non-perturbative regime.
    - Dynamical Quarks: Implementation of simulations that include the effects of dynamical quarks, offering a more realistic representation compared to the quenched approximation.
    - Wilson Fermions: Use of Wilson fermions for the lattice discretization of the quark fields, which helps to avoid the problem of fermion doubling.
    - Monte Carlo Simulation: Application of Monte Carlo algorithms, including the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, to sample gauge field configurations.
    - Gauge Field Configurations: Analysis of gauge field configurations and measurement of observables such as the Wilson loop to study confinement.

This project successfully implements a lattice QCD simulation with dynamical quarks, providing insights into the non-perturbative behavior of QCD. The results obtained are consistent with theoretical expectations and demonstrate the effectiveness of lattice methods in studying quantum field theories.
